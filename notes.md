## PhotoZ
---
* u is not very code
* color indices g,r,i,z -> g-r, r-i, i-z
* color - color diagram (the differences in each others function)
* training set from Beck and test set on SSDS DR7 or split the training set
* petrosian magnitude instead of model mag -> extinction is needed here but not on the model mags
* acquire with small photometric err, set err threshold as a parameter
